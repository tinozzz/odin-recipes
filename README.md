# odin-recipes
The odin-recipes project revolves around familiarizing myself with the html fundamentals encapsulated in a github repository. The main homepage provides recipe links and in those recipe links contain an image, ingredients, and cooking instructions for the respective recipe. 

html skills that I have demonstrated within this project are:
- elements and tags
- working with text
- lists
- links and images
