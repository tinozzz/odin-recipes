        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes
            and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes.
            Drain and mash. Mix in butter, finely chopped onion and 1/4
            cup shredded cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste;
            set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add carrots
            and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes.
            Drain, mash and set aside. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F
            (190 degrees C.)</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large frying pan. Add onion and cook until
            clear. Add ground beef and cook until well browned. Pour
            off excess fat, then stir in flour and cook 1 minute. Add
            ketchup and beef broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and
            simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spread the ground beef in an even layer on the bottom of a
            2 quart casserole dish. Next, spread a layer of mashed
            carrots. Top with the mashed potato mixture and sprinkle
            with remaining shredded cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until golden
            brown.</li>
